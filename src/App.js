          <p> I've been involved in CSESoc for my entire time at University, in the <b> Careers Portfolio. </b> Last year I was in the <b>Careers Subcommitee</b>, and this year I was fortunate enough to be <b>Careers Director</b>, alongside Bec and Srija. </p>
          <p> Having additional experience as both <b> Treasurer </b> and <b> Arc Delegate (x2)</b>, I feel uniquely positioned to be able to help CSESoc work through its rapid expansion, and come out on the other side greater than ever. </p>
          <p> I still remember my first motivation to join CSESoc: being convinced by Shrey to join. While my motivations have changed, I can confidently say it was the best decision of my uni life thus far. </p>
          <h3> Why Me? </h3>
          <p> My main motivation for running for Exec is to give back even further to a community which has granted me so many opportunities, and to propel CSESoc into even greater leagues. </p>
          <p> I have a few main goals I am aiming to achieve next year: </p>
          <li> Prioritise mental health for the entire team </li> 
          <li> Foster an inclusive society-wide culture with more society-wide events </li>
          <li> Create a more approachable CSESoc, internally and externally </li>

          <p> Here's some more general information about me! </p>
          <br />
          <li> I love music! I play guitar and piano, and I sing. </li>
          <li> I also love musicals. On the right you can see me in the background playing Kurt in Heathers. </li>
          <li> I even have a youtube channel where I posted a few covers a few years back ... </li>
          <li> Moving away from music, I currently tutor COMP1531 :D </li>
